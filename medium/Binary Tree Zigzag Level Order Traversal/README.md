Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

Example 1:
![Example_1_img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
``` 

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
