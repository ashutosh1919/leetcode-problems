Given a string `s`, find two disjoint palindromic subsequences of `s` such that the product of their lengths is maximized. The two subsequences are disjoint if they do not both pick a character at the same index.

Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

Example 1:
![Example_1_img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/24/two-palindromic-subsequences.png)
```
Input: s = "leetcodecom"
Output: 9
Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "ete" for the 1st subsequence and "cdc" for the 2nd subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 3 * 3 = 9.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bb"
Output: 1
Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "b" (the first character) for the 1st subsequence and "b" (the second character) for the 2nd subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 1 * 1 = 1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "accbcaxxcxx"
Output: 25
Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "accca" for the 1st subsequence and "xxcxx" for the 2nd subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 5 * 5 = 25.
``` 

Constraints:
- `2 <= s.length <= 12`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
