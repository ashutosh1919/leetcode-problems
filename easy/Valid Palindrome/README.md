Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
``` 

Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.
