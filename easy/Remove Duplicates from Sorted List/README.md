Given the `head` of a **sorted** linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example 1:
![Example_1_img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/list1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```
Example 2:
![Example_2_img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/list2.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
``` 

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.
