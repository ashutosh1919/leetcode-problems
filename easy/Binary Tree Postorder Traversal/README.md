Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:  
![Example_1_img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/pre1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```
Example 4:  
![Example_4_img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/pre3.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```
Example 5:  
![Example_5_img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/pre2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: [2,1]
``` 

Constraints:
- The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
